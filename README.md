# Leetcode
This is a place where I record my [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) submissions

## How to read these solutions
1. Each folder has a file called my_solution.* that has my successful solution to the problem
2. Each folder also has a README.md file that records the number of successful attempts and number of failed attemts
    * An attempt is one leetcode session (about 30 mins to 2 hours for me)
3. The ```Notes``` section of the README records any solutions I used for my final solution (either inspired my solution or I used major parts)
